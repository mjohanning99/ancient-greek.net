    <p>Previously I discussed how I had bought a commentated copy of Xenophon's Anabasis and said that I would be writing about my approach to studying the book; and this is what I now attempt to do. Indeed, the book has been in my possession for a longer period of time already, but I have been both unable to work through it at a great pace and to find the time to actually write something about it. However, as I currently have some time to spare, I shall now give you a short account of how I have been using this book to help me advance my Greek</p>
    <p>Firstly, it is rather helpful that the vocabulary is lay out in such a way that you can learn only the vocabulary of a certain page you wish to be reading; this allows one study the most commonly used words piece by piece, whilst also reading the appropriate pages whilst doing so. This greatly helps one in retaining the information; and I also believe that seeing words used in context is much more helpful than simply learning flash cards that, frequently, do not provide any context whatsoever (there are indeed ways of accomplishing it, I realise, but they are, I would venture to guess, not used as frequently). In addition, the comments located at the bottom of each page provide further insights and explain all the other vocabulary that does not appear in the list at the front of the book.</p>
    <p>The combination of all of the above makes going through this book rather a breeze and much easier than I had imagined; although, I must admit that the writing style is, perhaps, slightly more difficult than I had imagined, hence my frequently referring to <q>Easy Selections Adapated from Xenophon</q>.</p>
    <p>I have, unfortunately, been unable to continue past the second page as I have been rather busy with work and school; but I shall attempt to continue my study of it on the weekend.</p>

    <h2>Hansen and Quinn — Unit 4</h2>
    <p>Additionally, I have begun working my way through Unit 4 of the <i>Intensive Course</i> and was rather surprised by how complicated conditional sentences in Attic Greek really are. I will be posting a more comprehensive overview of them on this website in due time, but for now, suffice it to say that there are over six different possible conditional sentence structures, each using a different tense and different words introducing the <i>protasis</i> and <i>apodosis</i>; I find it quite interesting how precise this language frequently is. However, I have only now (Monday) finished the <q>teaching portion</q> of the Unit and am now going to be going through the last drill and begin working my way through the numerous exercises this Unit has to offer. Interesting, too, is the fact that the sentences one is required to translate slowly begin to grow longer and more complicated — this is obviously to be expected, but I still find it rather intereting to observe. This Unit is actually the first one which provides a small handful of <i>actual</i> Greek text written back in the day, so I rather think it will become more interesting hereafter. </p>
