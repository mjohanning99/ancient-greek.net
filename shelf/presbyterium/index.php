  <p class="blocktext">I welcome you warmly to the Presbyterium — the Council of Elders —, where old books have their dwelling place. Indeed, my definition of old is, perhaps, somewhat flexible in this case, though I do not count anything released in the 21<sup>st</sup> century as old. You will, however, find books from any area before the current century on this page — at least those that are, in one way or another, related to Ancient Greek.</p>
  <p>As I have only recently begun my collection of old books, this page will fill only gradually; I still need to find a suitable storage place for them in my apartment even. However, be sure to check back here every so often to see whether new members have joined the Council.</p>
