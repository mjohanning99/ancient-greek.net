  <p class="blocktext">Lacking a better way of expressing the concept of <q>virtuality</q> in Ancient Greek, I chose, instead, to simply say that these are the books which are <i>false</i> or <i>unreal</i>. These are, obviously, rather plentiful, as many books were written in the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century which are now in the public domain. It is therefore rather difficult to find ones which are helpful and which may aid one in one’s learning of the language and knowing which ones to discard. Below you will find something not even close to resembling an entire list, but rather a short overview of the virtual books I am using or have used to study this language. As always, click the links to get to my review about it.</p>
