  <p class="blocktext">The year 2020 was the one during which I seriously began my study of this fascinating language. I used a variety of textbooks and reviewed my process in irregular blog posts on my website; shortly afterwards, however, I decided to simply delete the blog, as I no longer found any use for it and was rather annoyed by its bloatedness. Therefore, the remnants of my old blog can be found below. I no longer have the exact dates of their publishing, but the majority of them must have been written in August to September.</p>
