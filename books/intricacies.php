  <p class="blocktext">The language spoken by the Ancient Egyptians is a very mystical language indeed. Spoken by a culture as old to the Romans as they are to us — it seems impossible for us to decipher these mysterious symbols and understand the words uttered by the kings of yore; yet, in this book, you will be learning the very basics of this language using real-world texts and for those wishing to delve even deeper into the culture behind this fascinating language, the two additional chapters on date-keeping and the Westcar Papyrus will provide you with further insight.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Intricacies of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglpyhics</h2>
          <p>This is the first book I have ever published. I started working on it in late 2018 and finally published in in March 2020, shortly after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. It describes how to read Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs in a way so that even people who are not linguists can pick up the book and know the basics of this writing system in a rather short period of time.</p>

        <h2>Obtaining your copy</h2>
        <p>At present, there are merely two ways of obtaining your own copy; you can either download the PDF from this website or get the book using its ISBN. The latter may, however, prove difficult. I am planning on re-publishing this book but under a different publisher so that it can be distributed internationally as well.</p>
