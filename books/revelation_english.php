  <p class="blocktext">The Revelation of John (or Apocalypse) is one of the most fascinating books of the entire New Testament; it is filled to the brim with colourful and powerful imagery and is as suspenseful as any modern story about the end of the world. This new and modern translation aims to turn the Revelation into a novel closely following the original scripture. Inline notes and comments ensure that the reader understands the context of a passage all the while clearly marking which parts of the translation are the translator's comments and suggestions. This way, the book can be read either more fluently or, if so desired, in a more literal translation. It is perfect for those who have yet to start studying the Bible and wish to start by reading the most interesting book the Bible has to offer.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">English-only edition of John’s Revelation</h2>
          <p>As you are surely aware, I published my first translation — the one which included the original text and illustrations after every chapter — of John’s Revelation (or Apocalypse) in the summer of last year. I had planned on selling it internationally, as my publisher was offering at the time, but was surprised to find out that international distribution was only offered for paperbacks. Additionally, the book’s rather steep price of €25.99 must have surely deterred many people from buying it.</p>

          <p>Therefore, it has been my plan to publish a cheaper — and more <q>mass-market</q> — version of my book for some time now; and this has now finally been done. This new English-only edition features a completely overhauled and modern design and a much lower price of only €9.99. I sincerely hope that this will ensure that a larger number of people will be able to afford the book and thus have the chance to read my translation.</p>

          <p>The new design and typesetting has been created to ensure that the book look and feel is more akin to that of a contemporary novel; I have, therefore, also decided to leave out line and verse numbers entirely. I want people to read this translation as if it <i>were</i> just another contemporary novel, albeit one with is, at times, somewhat strangely worded.</p>

        <h2>Obtaining your copy</h2>
        <p>The book can be bought in most major countries in the world, especially those that have Amazon. Simply look for the ISBN stated above on Amazon and you should be able to find the book there. The prices may differ, but should be around $10. On Amazon, you should also be able to find the Kindle e-book for roughly half the price of the paperback; it has been very nicely formatted by my publisher and is easily readable on a Kindle device. </p>
