        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Translation of the Apocalypse</h2>
          <p class="blocktext">I have been working on my own translation of the Revelation for quite a while now and decided it was time to finally publish it as a book. It is published and printed by the <a href="https://www.bod.de">Books on Demand GmbH</a> in Germany. The initial release consists of an e-book version and a dust-jacketed hard-cover, with the latter costing €25.99 and the former €4.49. A cheaper (probably around €14.99) paperback version will also be released over the course of the next few months. </p>

          <p class="blocktext">BoD also offers to distribute the book internationally, an offer that I will gladly take advantage of; it does, however, have the rather big disadvantage of the books distributed in this manner not being in colour — which is, indeed, a bummer.  If you live outside of Germany, please refer to the section titled <q>Obtaining your copy</q> on how to obtain an edition printed in colour.</p>

        <h2>Obtaining your copy</h2>
				<p>There are numerous ways of obtaining your own copy of the book; the most complicated one would be the acquisition of the book’s <a href="https://github.com/mjohanning99/Revelation-Translation">source code</a> and compiling it yourself. The second, and perhaps easier way, of obtaining a digital copy of the book is to either read it online (see below) or to buy the original e-book. If you prefer physical media, you can also buy the book directly from your local book store by providing them with the ISBN (978-3-7543-2897-2). The book will be printed on demand and should generally arrive within a week or so.</p>

        <p>If the book is not available in your country — or if it is the aforementioned black and white edition —, then I encourage you to send an email to orders@ancient-greek.net (by doing so you agree to our <a href="/privacy/privacy-policy.php">Privacy Policy</a>). I will create a personal offer for you depending on your location and preferred mode of shipping.

    <h2>Blurb</h2>
    <p class="blocktext">The Apocalypse of John is one of the most fascinating books of the entire New Testament; it is filled to the brim with colourful and powerful imagery and is as suspenseful as any modern story about the end of the World. In this new and modern translation, you will find not only a pleasant-to-read (but still faithful to the original) edition of the Revelation, but also the original Greek text on the opposite page and plenty of notes to help you understand the original scripture.</p>
