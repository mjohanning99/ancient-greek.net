    <p>Ancient Egyptian, the language and the culture wherefrom it developed, has always been of great interest to me; it should, thus, come as no surprise that I was — and still am — quite fascinated with this peculiar language. It might therefore be somewhat strange to find out that I have stopped my study of the language, about which I have even written a book; and so, to inform those that may be wondering why I did so, I shall herein attempt to briefly explain the reasons I had for abandoning my study of the language.</p>
    <p>Firstly, learning the vocabulary for this language had always been a nuisance for me, as I was unable to actually enter any of the words into a regular flash card program — such as Anki — without first using JSesh to create an <i>image</i> of the hieroglyphs which I would then have to import into the program. Additionally, I have always been rather awful at drawing, and so actually writing the hieroglyphs by hand was rather impossible — I did attempt to do so on a number of occasions, but to no avail. This, obviously, made studying new words a nigh unattainable task and I had to simply give up after a while.</p>
    <p>Secondly, finding adequate resources, too, was not as easy as I had at first thought; indeed, there <i>do</i> exist a number of rather decent resources for this language, but a lot of them were rather difficult to obtain — as a majority of them was written some hundred years ago — and difficult to use. The resources that <i>were</i> easily available and somewhat approachable were, unfortunately, only rather shallow when it comes to grammar and vocabulary. In addition, they mostly taught you how to read inscriptions of various kinds — which is an understandable approach, as the majority of the remaining texts written in Ancient Egyptian <i>are</i> such inscriptions — which, unfortunately, were somewhat boring to me. It was certainly interesting, no doubt, but I was more interested in reading actual texts, such as the <i>Book of the Dead</i> or <i>The Story of the Shipwrecked Sailor</i>; and this brings me to my final point, namely the available literature.</p>
    <p>Now, this is not to say that the literature of Ancient Egypt was boring or bad, but it was simply not what I had hoped and, in addition to that, it was scarce. This is in stark contrast to the literature of Ancient Egypt of which there is <i>a lot</i> and most of it is rather interesting to read. In addition, this literature was a influenced what we now refer to was <q>Western Culture</q> quite significantly and thus, reading texts people had written about these concepts we now hold when they were first developed and that, too, in the original language is quite invigorating.
