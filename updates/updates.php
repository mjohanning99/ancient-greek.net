  <h2>February 12, 2022 — A New Book!</h2>

  </figure><br>
  <p>Hello there everyone. I have returned with some, hopefully, rather good news. Some time ago, I published my book which has, as of today, actually sold eighteen copies already; however, as I was certain that this number would increase if its price wasn’t as steep, I decided to write and publish and English-only edition of my book with a modern and sleek design and no illustrations.</p>
  <p>All of these steps allowed me to decrease the book’s price to €9.99 all the while still getting the same amount of money from each purchase. Additionally, I am hoping that my publisher will approve this version for international distribution, which would mean that even those living in, for example, the US would be able to buy the book from Amazon without horrendous shipping costs.</p>
  <p>The book has yet to get approved, but I do not see why it shouldn’t be. If you’re interested in seeing what it will look like, you can head over to <a href="/books/revelation_english.php">the book’s informational page on this site</a> and download the PDF ebook.</p>
  
  <h2>February 9, 2022 — Welcome to a New Year</h2>
  <p>I wish you all a very happy new year, albeit a rather belated one. I have, unfortunately, been unable to continue working on my website, as I have been rather busy with a bunch of other things. I will continue working on my book soon and will be updating my website further in the upcoming weeks — but I cannot, as of yet, give you an exact date.</p>
