  <p class="blocktext">I bid you welcome! You have reached the Agora of ancient-greek.net, a small (but growing) corner of the Web; and I hope you enjoy your stay! The Agora is the hub of the page, from where you can begin your journey into the various topics; click the <i>Agora</i> button at the top left to return here.</p>

  <p>This website — as its name may have already made you realise — contains countless pages regarding the Ancient Greek language and country. <br>It is not, however, entirely focussed on the Classical Period of Greece (a period spanning roughly 200 years between the fifth and fourth centuries BC), but rather anything Greek-related spanning from the Classical Period up until the Byzantine. <br>The website’s main focus is the Ancient Greek language, however, and the majority of the information you find here will be about the language. For a more detailed overview, I would highly recommend you visit the <a href="about.php">About page</a>.</p>
